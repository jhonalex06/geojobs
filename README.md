I created this notebook to find which province of Canada has more job opportunities considering a key phrase using web scraping on the web page Indeed. I made a video showing an instance with the keyphrase “junior data analyst”. I expect this notebook will be helpful for everybody.

I will be attentive if you want to use other phrases to discover different results. Thanks for your attention
